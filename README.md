I hope you enjoyed my workshop!
If you are wondering "Now that the workshop is done, **where do we go from here?**". You came to the right place!

I'll share with you useful Courses, Youtube Channels, Asset Sources in here, please enjoy!


# Courses

Let's start with Online courses, if you want to continue your game development journey, the best way to do so is to **continue learning**, so here are a list of some courses that can help you:

### Online course
[Gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) are by far the best place to start learning, they offer courses +30 hours long that often go for about 50-60 riyals.
While it is not free, this is my recommened next step for continuing your journey.
you can also check out [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=Game+Development)) as they have many courses that can get you started on your game dev journey.

### Bootcamps
If you cannot afford or simply don't prefer self studying online, there are many bootcamps available for Game development in Saudi Arabia. With some digging you can definitely find on-site workshops and bootcamps.
The biggest advantage bootcamps is allowing you to connect with fellow Game devs!

### University courses
Some universities (such as King Abdulaziz University) offer free courses about game development, especially in Computer Science Faculties.

### Youtube
While it is inefficient to learn from Youtube due to the unstructured nature of it, there are some great playlists and videos that teach you how to make games, here are some for Unity:
[Brackey- How to make a Video Game in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL)
[GMTK - The Unity Tutorial For Complete Beginners](https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM?si=Zk-EpHk7opqCZKii)

Of course, not everyone prefer Unity as their game engine of choice, so here are some tutorials for Godot, an powerful, free, open-source Game engine:
[Brakeys - How to make a Video Game in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0)
[Brakeys - How to program in Godot - GDScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1zJS31tr88&t=131s)
[Build a full 3D fps in Godot as fast as possible. Tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqvNNQQPPS8&t=812s)


### GDC Valut
If you want to delve into more detailed topics, [GDC vault](gdcvault.com) is a collection of all the workshops given in the annual Game Design Conference, one of the biggest events in the Game development space! You can search through the vault to find information about almost any topic you can think of!

These are just some sources, there are tons of sources available! ask your fellow game devs! everyone will be happy to help!


# Game Jams
Now that you have some experience making games and ready for a challenge, you can participate in a game jam!
_**game jams are competitions that task you with making a game from scratch in a limited amount of time, usually based on a theme.**_
There are many local and online game jams happening around the year, most of them happen on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/jams).
Some jams prefer to host their jams on a separate website like [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), and [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/)

if you are wondering which one you should join, I recommend the following:
- [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) is a 3-day annual game jam that is hosted locally everywhere around the world, if you are in Jeddah, [Dev Play Go](https://x.com/DevPlayGo) host the jam every year, you can follow their Twitter(or X) page and stay up to date with the jam!
- [Brakeys Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-12) is a 7-days bi-annual online game jam hosted by the Brakeys youtube channel, it is one of the biggest game jams every year, and give you 7 days to make your game.
- [Pirate Software Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate) is a 2-week jam hosted by a veteran Game developer and streamer "Thor". The unqiue difference in this jam is the requirement to submit a Game Design Document (GDD), which is a document that describes how your game is designed.

Game jams are a great way to learn, and interact with the community! Don't be fret to join one, the community welcomes new game devs!
